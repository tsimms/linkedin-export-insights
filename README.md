Report on annual LinkedIn engagement

Okay, you've made it here, so you must be interested in seeing what I've done. Flattering! And I hope I this project doesn't disappoint you.

Background
So, LinkedIn doesn't provide access to any sort of public API, from what I can tell. I had looked into this a while back, and it seemed you had to be subscribed to their partner program or one of their premium subscriptions to get whatever was available. So that kinda sucks.. But, thanks to data privacy regulations (I'm guessing), they must provide you access to your own data. So thanks GDPR! Thanks CPRA! Unfortunately, they make it kinda hard to navigate to, and as a result, most people don't even know it's there.

All good. I've got you! Happy to step you through some shortcuts to get you your own data.

- First off, log into your [LinkedIn account](https://linkedin.com/), on a desktop browser.
- Once logged in, make your way over to the [Export Your Data Page](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/download-my-data).
- Choose the top option for "Download larger data archive..." and click the "Request archive" button.
- Yes, it will take a while to process.. you may get an email tomorrow, but you may not (I didn't this last time I requested it). If that's the case, just leave the page open and refresh it tomorrow after 24h has elapsed. When it's ready, there will be a link to download the archive. Do that!

Okay, so that's all you need to worry about for now. That will get you the zip archive of all your LinkedIn activity. Keep that safe once you get it (e.g. don't download to a shared or a public-use computer, etc.)! Come back to this page once that's complete!

Now the data is fine for nerds like me, but you're probably wondering what you can do with it.. Glad you asked!

This project will give you your annual engagement across four main categories:
1. Messages. That is, the number of individual messages you _sent_. While people usually start here on LinkedIn, it's not the only way (and in fact, it's not my preferred way) to build strong connections with other. Keep reading...
2. Reactions. Better known as _likes_, but you know, LinkedIn decided to get all fancy like the cool kids, and now allow you to react with like, celebrate, support, funny, love, insightful, and curious. Fun fact: in LinkedIn data land, they call these: LIKE, PRAISE, EMPATHY, ENTERTAINMENT, APPRECIATION, INTEREST, and MAYBE, respectively... üëàüèΩ I find it amusing that they use "MAYBE" to describe "curious"! üòÅ Apparently, I've only used it once in the past 5 years. lol
3. Comments. THIS, right here! the bread-and-butter of your ability to begin interacting with folks... _not_ in DMs!
4. Shares. These are your posts; the place you're able to create true value for your network (and in turn for yourself). This is most often the area where people spend the least time. For most with a little time to invest, I'd say this is a great place to begin your new LinkedIn strategy.

So let's get to it!

Download the files in this project to a folder on your computer (yeah, I know, that sounds sketch, but I promise it's legit.. and I'll give you some alternative methods to running the project here!

Methods you can use to get the report on your data:
1.  Download the files to your computer. this includes using `git clone ...`, but most aren't familiar with how to do that. Once you have all the files in a folder (let's say you just downloaded them to the Downloads folder), you'd go to Chrome (or another modern browser) and navigate to [file:///Users/myname/Downloads/index.html](file:///Users/myname/Downloads/index.html) (...replacing myname with your username on your computer). Happy to help you with that if you have trouble deciphering what to use.. hit me up.
2.  I've hosted this project on [one of my sites](https://influentmetrics.com/projects/linkedin-export-insights/) (I've got a project on the books to revamp a personal site where this stuff will go in the future).

It's important to know that your data should remain private to you. In both of the two methods above, the app works without sending any of your data over the Internet. It's completely self-contained (and open source, so you can verify if you so choose). In fact, once you have the files downloaded to your computer, there's really no requirement to be connected to the Internet at all (hehehe -- I'm just realizing most won't know the concept of a computer that doesn't have Internet access, but that's a fun lil history lesson for another day)! ü§¶üèΩ

Okay, once you get to the page, click the button, and plug in the .zip file you've already downloaded to your computer. It'll chart out your engagement, so you can see how you've been doing over the years.
